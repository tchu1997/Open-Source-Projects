### Technologies

Languages: Javascript, HTML, CSS

Database: Firestore

### Features
- User sign up/login/logout
- Content is hidden if user is not logged in
- Add items to cart
- Clear cart
- Alert when user orders more than allowed

### Thoughts
- Firebase is only good for small projects with small databases
- User signup and authentication is quite easy, but not very secured
- Scripts execute before the page is fully loaded, so there needs a function that prevents some cripts from running too fast (to perform a click event after all resources have loaded, for example)
- Lots of material designs
